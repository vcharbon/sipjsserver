/**
 * WorkerRegistry — D3 of the SIP Front Proxy plan.
 *
 * Tracks the set of B2BUA workers the proxy can route to. Three concrete
 * impls land across the plan:
 *
 *   - `kubernetesStatefulSet` (PR5, production) — driven by a K8s `Pod` watch.
 *   - `static` (this PR, dev/local) — env-driven, no dynamic updates.
 *   - `simulated` (this PR, tests) — explicit add/remove/setHealth controls
 *     so unit tests can drive registry events deterministically.
 *
 * D4 invariant — the routing path is non-blocking. `snapshot` and `resolve`
 * MUST only do `Ref.get` (and pure HashMap reads). They MUST NOT call
 * `Effect.sleep`, perform I/O, or otherwise suspend on anything other than
 * the unconditional Ref read. Background fibers (K8s watch, HealthProbe)
 * own all suspending work; they update an in-memory `SubscriptionRef` and
 * the routing path snapshots it lock-free.
 *
 * `changes` is a Stream backed by `SubscriptionRef.changes`-style fan-out:
 * each registry mutation emits one tagged `RegistryEvent` so consumers can
 * react incrementally rather than diffing snapshots.

 * unknown means we haven't yet confirmed anything. Routing-side filters
 * MUST treat unknown as not-routable for new dialogs (same as dead). The
 * distinction is preserved so future hysteresis on `dead → alive` recovery
 * (e.g. require N consecutive 200 OKs before re-admitting) does not also
 * penalize cold-start workers.
 *
 * `not-ready` is the state of a worker that has answered an OPTIONS probe
 * with `503 + Reason: not-ready (boot drain)` (Slice E1 of the
 * decode-forward-respawn fix): the worker process is alive, but its
 * `WorkerReadiness` gate is still false because boot-time replication
 * drain has not finished. In-dialog requests routed to this worker would
 * miss because its sidecar Redis is empty / still hydrating, so the proxy
 * promotes `decode_forward → decode_forward_backup` for cookies that name
 * a `not-ready` primary.
