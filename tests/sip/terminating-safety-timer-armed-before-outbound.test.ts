/**
 * Regression — `terminating_timeout` safety net must be installed *before*
 * the slow outbound yield, otherwise a handler abort orphans the call.
 *
 * Production symptom (kind cluster, 2026-05-15):
 *   worker-1 logs "Timer handler keepalive_timeout … exceeded 5000ms — handler
 *   did not return", and the same call surfaces ~5 min later under "[CallState]
 *   Orphan sweep recovering terminating call …". The orphan-sweep BYE then
 *   leaks into the next test's signaling trace and is scored as [UNEXPECTED].
 *
 * Mechanism:
 *   `TimerService.schedule` wraps each timer handler in
 *   `Effect.timeoutOrElse(timerHandlerTimeoutMs)`. If the handler exceeds the
 *   budget (event-loop freeze, slow UDP write, etc.) it is interrupted at the
 *   next yield. The current `SipRouter.processResult` runs in this order:
 *     (1) callState.update — mutates the in-memory call to
 *         `state: "terminating"`,
 *     (2) for-each outbound: `txnLayer.send(BYE, …)`,
 *     (3) for-each effect: schedule-timer(terminating_timeout +64s), etc.
 *
 *   The race we observed: the abort fires *after* (1) but *before* the
 *   `schedule-timer` in (3). The call sits in `terminating` with no fiber in
 *   TimerService to drive its safety net.
 *
 * Invariant locked in by this test:
 *   For any handler that produces a `state: "terminating"` mutation alongside
 *   a `schedule-timer(terminating_timeout)` effect, the safety timer MUST be
 *   installed in `TimerService.fibersMap` before the handler yields to any
 *   long IO. This test exercises `TimerService.schedule` directly with two
 *   sibling cases — pre-fix order vs. post-fix order — and asserts the
 *   schedule call was made (i.e. visible in fibersMap immediately after the
 *   abort) only in the post-fix order.
 *
 *   The test is synthetic — it doesn't depend on the rule chain or SipRouter
 *   wiring — but it exercises the exact `TimerService.schedule` wrap and
 *   `timerHandlerTimeoutMs` budget that produced the production log line. If
 *   `processResult` is ever re-ordered to send outbound before timer effects,
 *   the post-fix case below will fail.

// NOTE on the Phase 5 structural fix:
//
// Pre-Phase 5 (the initial reordering patch), the two cases below
// were intended to demonstrate the bug: with `mutate → slow → schedule`
// the safety fiber was NEVER installed when the handler was
// interrupted by the per-handler budget. The reordering patch in
// SipRouter.processResult made the "post-fix" order land safely.
//
// Phase 5 (this commit) closes the gap structurally: every
// `callState.update(... → terminating)` *itself* installs the
// safety timer atomically with the state mutation, inside an
// `Effect.uninterruptibleMask`. So even the "pre-fix" handler order
// — mutate, then yield to a slow IO that gets interrupted, never
// reaching the explicit `schedule` line — leaves the call with its
// safety fiber armed, because the `update` call took care of it.
//
// Both cases now PASS the same invariant: after the handler is
// aborted, the in-memory call is in `terminating` AND TimerService
// has a `terminating_timeout` fiber active. The test stays in the
// suite as a perimeter test for the structural guarantee. See:
//   - docs/adr/0003-must-run-effects-under-interruption.md
//   - docs/plan/this-kind-of-issue-flickering-moth.md (Phase 5)
//   - tests/call/callstate-arms-safety-on-terminating.test.ts (the
//     direct unit test for the structural fix).
